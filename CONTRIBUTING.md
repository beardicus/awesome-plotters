# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing! I am quite open to pull requests and other forms of help. If you are not comfortable with Git and pull requests please feel free to open an issue and suggest links that way, or just tweet me at [@bertmb](https://twitter.com/bertmb).

I'm still feeling out the guidelines for what is "worthy" of inclusion here. If you're unsure, feel free to open an issue to discuss before putting in the effort of writing things up for a pull request.

Also, please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate
* enter a meaningful pull request description
* make an individual commit for each suggestion in a pull request
* organizational improvements are always welcome, but are probably best discussed in an issue first
* if your link needs a new category/header, go ahead and make one (be sure to update the _Contents_ section as well)
* keep descriptions short and simple
* check your spelling and grammar

I am definitely a stickler for consistent formatting and language, so forgive me if I update your contribution before or after merging.

Thanks again!
